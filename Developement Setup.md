Something about windows doesn't seem right anymore for programming. Yes, it's meant for everybody's use but that's the part where it lacks for programmers. At starting phase, it looks just fine; code editor, development servers, database initialization, program files etc. But that's not all programmers require sometimes. It's the enviroment. See, windows is great for those who want to balance between code and life with day-to-day uses. While for those who want to something more, they require something that is more closer to the system hardware. Something that is custumizable, open and not maintained by a monopoly. Perhaps all this is leading to Linux?

Have been spending half of the day actually in debian today. Quite challenging for someone who loves challenges.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
